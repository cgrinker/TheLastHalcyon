# One

## Some Snap Intro
Sameji stood in the *Centaur's* airlock, listening to the hiss of the oxygen
as it pumped back into the tanks. Soon the sound faded away, punctuated by the chime of the wall panel:

`EVACUATION COMPLETE. DISENGAGE OUTER DOOR?`

She tapped the touchscreen and the hatch retracted revealing Athea's twin moons against a 
backdrop of stars. All that remained was the sound of her breathing and the steady
hum of her suit's life support system. Sameji closed her eyes and steading her breathing,
straining for a moment of calm before the coming `clusterfuck` //TODO don't swear

"We're three minutes to intercept. Killing the main rector now," Jamie's voice crackled through her headset, disrupting her zen.

*Never a moment's peace* though Sameji. She rolled her left wrist over to activate her suit's HUD.
A 3D solarmap appeared over her arm showing Athea and five other planets orbiting an orange star. She gestured to zoom in. revealing the Centaur approaching a chevron marked GMS *Asterius*. Two ships in the vast emptiness of the system. No one to happen upon them accidently
during thei unannounced visit. The Centuar groaned as it powered down and the main lights gave way to the faint red glow of the battery
backups. Sameji though back to Jamie's mission briefing on the bridge four hours earlier. 

## Mission Plan
It wasn't a particularly complicated plan, though what it lacked in complexity it surely made up for `hairbrained-ness`. Cargo ships leaving the system accelerate slowly to preserve fuel for the vast journey between stars. They'd left Athea and slingshot around its second moon to catch up with the *Asterius*, performing a reverse burn to put on a *safeish* overtake speed with the *Asterius*. As they approached they powered down to avoid the freighter's sonar pings. The *Centuar* had a kill switch for it's transponder installed by an unscruplus public Inspector making them nearly invisible against the black background of the cosmos. Sameji would board the *Asterius* through its docking hatch as Jamie lapped the *Centaur* around `the other moon`, and retrieved the case for their employer. What was in the case was none of their business. One she had the case Sameji would escape through the hatch and wait for the *Centuar* to swing back around to pick her up.

"This will be a walk in the park," said Jamie. "Somehow I doubt that," replied Sameji. Nothing ever goes according to plan in Space Piracy. 


## Snap Back to Sameji on the ship
Sameji activated her magnetic boots and began walking up the inner airlock wall. Her HUD flickered and distorted as her orientation changed. Without a neural interlink she had to rely on dated Terran technology from the early days of Athea's colonization like the light
projectors that drove her AR display. She toggled off the solar map. Prolonged usage of the projectors would lead to motion sickness, not
something you would want when jumping between two starships traveling 1000 kilometers a second. Sameji checked the batteries on her electronic belay device and figeted with the release bar, anxiously wating for `prime time`.

"We're coming up on them now, firing the grappler," squacked her radio. A long tube on the outside of the hull pivoted into position and fired a magnetic cylander with a tether attached at the *Asterius*, attaching midway across the top of it's bow. Sameji crouched against the interior hatch in a sprinters starting position and took a deep breath.

"Have a good time over there!" she heard Jamie taunt over the radio.

*This is the worst part of these jobs* thought Saemji. She pushed off as hard as she could, like leaping off a diving board, soaring through the outer hatch and out in the vaccum of space.

Sameji eyed the reflactors of the tether and followed them back to a winch quickly spooling dodwn to the end if its length. She had little time to secure herself to the line before they'd have to disengage the winch. She activated the RCS thrusters on her suit and powered towards the center of the tether, belay device in hand. As she aproached the cable she opened the device, quickly threading the line through both ends and hovered her finger over electronic auto brake. "We're out of line I'm cutting the cable," Jamie annouced. Sameji braced inside her suit. *Now comes the awful part.*

Sameji engaged the auto brake as the launch tube released it's guillotine, cleanly severing the tether. The slack between the belay device and the *Asterius* evaporated and the line quickly began to strech. Even with the elasticity of the tether and the compensation from the suit Sameji felt the crushing g-forces, struggling to remain consious. Just as the darkness began to creep into her eyes the tension in the line relaxed, slowly returning to its original size. Sameji began realing herself into to the *Asterius*, rythmically alternating between pulling the tether through her belay device and removing the lack from the other side. *Two hands on at all times* she reminded herself. Accidents happen when you don't stick to the basics.


## Hack the Planet
* Hatch code doesn't work
* Attaches decoder, some kinda fliper zero shit comes up
* Hatch opens but some kind of alarm is going to be triggered
* Waiting around for airlock to repressurize 


## Bouncing around the ship
* Bouncing off the walls and shit following some radar (draw a radar?)
* Radar detects some nerd, tranq gun that bitch.
* Hide the body in a storage closet.
* Few more turns and we're at the prize.

## Grab and go
* Codes still don't work drills through some door
* Grabs the case and makes an exit
* Alarm goes off
* Fucking space marines show up
* Some kind of soft ammo hitting the walls.
* "At least we won't explosively decompress" 

## Explosive decompression
* Gets to the airlock and gets inside the door
* Gets door jammed half open. Getting sprayed at.
* Taking too long, hits the emergency decompression with the drill
* `Google how much air you can have in there before you fucking die to explosive decompression`
* Goes to fire the hookshot, doesn't stick. Starts tumblling off into space.
* Can't call Jamie on the comms.
* Puts suit into low air mode for a nice hypoxia nap

## Uber everywhere
* Hears my dumb song over the radio 
* Jamie is on her way back to pick her up.
* They get back on board do some fun banter.
* Jamie rants about music
* Sameji tells her she should make her own.
* Head back to the planet for payday
