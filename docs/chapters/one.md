# One

## Some Snap Intro
* Standing on top of the ship with mag boots
* Sounds like a shitty plan
* Some number of months left before she can get her BCI
* Describe some suit perks 


## Mission Plan
* Bad ship is on it's way out of solar system (slow acceleration funtime)
* We slingshot around the moon, cut our drives to intercept at an angle
* Grapple over, use our codes to open the airlock
* Ez PZ


## Snap Back to Sameji on the ship
* Ships about to intercept. 
* Sameji launches, uses her thrusters to slow within acceptable G's
* Flight computer does all the work
* Now comes the shitty part. 
* Aural hookshot targetting baby!
* Grapples, nearly blacks out. 
* Winch begins auto retracting.

## Hack the Planet
* Hatch code doesn't work
* Attaches decoder, some kinda fliper zero shit comes up
* Hatch opens but some kind of alarm is going to be triggered
* Waiting around for airlock to repressurize 


## Bouncing around the ship
* Bouncing off the walls and shit following some radar (draw a radar?)
* Radar detects some nerd, tranq gun that bitch.
* Hide the body in a storage closet.
* Few more turns and we're at the prize.

## Grab and go
* Codes still don't work drills through some door
* Grabs the case and makes an exit
* Alarm goes off
* Fucking space marines show up
* Some kind of soft ammo hitting the walls.
* "At least we won't explosively decompress" 

## Explosive decompression
* Gets to the airlock and gets inside the door
* Gets door jammed half open. Getting sprayed at.
* Taking too long, hits the emergency decompression with the drill
* `Google how much air you can have in there before you fucking die to explosive decompression`
* Goes to fire the hookshot, doesn't stick. Starts tumblling off into space.
* Can't call Jamie on the comms.
* Puts suit into low air mode for a nice hypoxia nap

## Uber everywhere
* Hears my dumb song over the radio 
* Jamie is on her way back to pick her up.
* They get back on board do some fun banter.
* Jamie rants about music
* Sameji tells her she should make her own.
* Head back to the planet for payday
